# PokeTypes: A Pokemon-Inspired Speed Typing Game

Type the names of the Pokemon as they appear on the screen before the time runs out to score points! This game was built in React as a project for Juno College's Immersive Web Development Bootcamp. Pokemon names and image urls are returned from the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>. 

NOTICE: The PokeAPI is rate limited at 100 calls per minute - please don't try to start a new game more than 2 times within a minute or else you will receive an error. Thanks!
